# 💡 Project Scope Summary

## 🎯 Goal
Deploy a **medical Q&A chatbot** powered by an AI model using modern **DevOps tools** and **Azure infrastructure**.

---

## 🧩 You Will Cover

### 📦 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use tools like **Terraform** and **ARM templates** to provision and manage Azure resources programmatically.

### 🐳 Containerization
- Package the chatbot and its services using **Docker** to ensure portability and consistency across environments.

### ☸️ Orchestration
- Deploy and manage containers using **Kubernetes (AKS)** for high availability, load balancing, and scalability.

### ⚙️ Configuration Management
- Implement tools like **Ansible** or **Helm** to automate environment setups and manage configuration drift.

### 📈 Monitoring
- Set up observability with tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Azure Monitor** to track performance and health metrics.

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines
- Automate testing, integration, and deployment using **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Jenkins**.

### ☁️ Cloud Provisioning
- Leverage **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** and **Terraform** to spin up infrastructure tailored to the chatbot’s needs.

### 🔐 Security & Scalability
- Enforce **RBAC**, **network policies**, **TLS**, and **firewalls** to secure services.
- Use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**, **Load Balancers**, and **CDNs** for scalable and responsive applications.

🛠️ This project is perfect for gaining hands-on experience with full DevOps pipelines and cloud-native application deployment!



🧠 Step 1: Define Core Components
Here’s the core flow of your chatbot project:

🔄 System Flow:
User sends a medical question via frontend (web or Postman).

Request hits a Python FastAPI service running in Kubernetes.

The API calls Google Gemini to get the answer.

API saves the Q&A to PostgreSQL database.

You use CI/CD to build & deploy the app.

Prometheus + Grafana monitor the app.

Infra is managed via Terraform, Helm, Docker, Ansible on Azure.

🧱 Step 2: List Your Components
Layer	Component
AI	Google Gemini API
Backend	Python (FastAPI or Flask)
Container	Docker
Orchestration	Kubernetes (AKS) + Helm
Infra as Code	Terraform (to provision AKS, PostgreSQL, ACR)
DB	PostgreSQL (Azure Database or self-hosted)
Monitoring	Prometheus + Grafana
Config Mgmt	Ansible
CI/CD	GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines
Hosting	Azure

✅ Phase 2 Goal
Create a working chatbot on your local machine that:

Accepts medical questions via an HTTP endpoint

Sends them to Google Gemini

Returns the answer

Optionally logs questions/answers in a database (we’ll use SQLite first)

🧱 App Architecture Overview
Tech Stack:

Flask: lightweight Python web framework (REST API)

Google Gemini API: for intelligent medical responses

SQLite: simple database to log questions/responses
